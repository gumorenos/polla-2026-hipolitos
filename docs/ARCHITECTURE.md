# Architecture — La Polla 2026

> Last updated: 2026-06-16

---

## 1. Goals

La Polla 2026 is a private World Cup 2026 prediction pool for small groups (20-50 people). It must be:

- **Self-hosted** — runs entirely on a Raspberry Pi 5 at home.
- **Private** — invite-code-only, no public registration.
- **Mobile-first** — PWA installable on iOS and Android.
- **Offline-tolerant** — works behind Cloudflare Tunnel; no SaaS dependencies.
- **Simple to operate** — single SQLite file, PM2 process manager, daily backups.

---

## 2. Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | SSR + Server Actions + PWA support |
| Language | TypeScript 5 | Type safety across full stack |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 | Utility-first, matches reference design system |
| Animations | Framer Motion 12 | Reference uses it; polished micro-interactions |
| Database | SQLite (via Prisma) | Zero-config, file-based, perfect for RPi5 single-instance |
| ORM | Prisma 7 | Type-safe queries, migration management |
| Auth | Better Auth | Native App Router support, Prisma adapter, email+password |
| Charts | Recharts 3 | Reference uses it; good React integration |
| Icons | Lucide React | Reference uses it; tree-shakeable |
| PWA | next-pwa or @ducanh2912/next-pwa | Manifest + service worker |
| Runtime | Node.js 22 (LTS) | ARM64 production builds, performance |
| Process manager | PM2 | Auto-restart, log management |
| Tunnel | Cloudflare Tunnel | HTTPS to LAN device without port forwarding |
| Backup | SQLite WAL + cron | Daily automated backup |

## 4. Database Design

### Provider and Storage Paths

SQLite via Prisma with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode enabled. The file storage is environment-dependent:
- **Local Windows Development:** Local file inside the repository: `file:./prisma/dev.db` (under `app/prisma/dev.db`). This file must never be committed.
- **Raspberry Pi 5 Production:** Stored outside the repository directory: `/var/lib/la-polla-2026/prod.db`. This directory must have read/write permissions for the application user.

### Key Differences from Reference (PostgreSQL) Schema

| Reference (PostgreSQL) | Our Schema (SQLite) | Reason |
|------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| `enum TournamentStatus` | String with Prisma enum | SQLite has no native enum type; Prisma validates at ORM layer |
| `enum RoundType` | String with Prisma enum | Same |
| `enum MatchStatus` | String with Prisma enum | Same |
| `enum LeagueStatus` | String with Prisma enum | Same |
| `enum ScoreType` | String with Prisma enum | Same |
| `enum Block` | String with Prisma enum | Same |
| PostgreSQL `uuid` | CUID via `@default(cuid())` | Portable across providers |

### Better Auth Additional Tables

Better Auth with Prisma adapter adds these tables to the schema:
- `User` — extended with `is_superadmin`, `display_name`, `whatsapp`
- `Session` — active sessions (cookie-based)
- `Account` — provider accounts (email+password credential)
- `Verification` — email verification tokens

### WAL Mode

SQLite WAL mode dramatically improves concurrent write capacity. Enable WAL mode via database connection options in `.env`:
- **Development:** `DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db?connection_limit=1&socket_timeout=20"`
- **Production:** `DATABASE_URL="file:/var/lib/la-polla-2026/prod.db?connection_limit=1&socket_timeout=20"`

And configure Prisma DB setup script/migrations to execute:
```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;
PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;
```

---

## 5. Authentication and Authorization Design

### Library: Better Auth

Better Auth is configured with the `username()` plugin, allowing users to register and log in using usernames and passwords rather than emails. Internally, a placeholder email (`username@polla.local`) is generated to satisfy database constraints.

Configuration (`lib/auth.ts`):
```ts
import { betterAuth } from 'better-auth';
import { username } from 'better-auth/plugins';
import { prismaAdapter } from 'better-auth/adapters/prisma';
import { prisma } from './db';

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: prismaAdapter(prisma, { provider: 'sqlite' }),
  emailAndPassword: { enabled: true },
  plugins: [username()],
  session: { cookieCache: { enabled: true, maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 } },
  trustedOrigins: [
    process.env.BETTER_AUTH_URL ?? process.env.APP_URL ?? 'http://localhost:3030',
  ],
});
```

### Session Strategy
- Server-side session stored in SQLite `Session` table.
- HttpOnly cookie — never exposed to JavaScript.
- 30-day session with sliding expiry.
- On RPi5: runs completely self-contained, no external auth service dependency.

### User Status and Authorization Model

Users must undergo an approval workflow. When a user registers, their account is initialized as `pending`. An administrator must approve their account before they can join pollas or make predictions.

| State | Access |
|-------|--------|
| Unauthenticated | Login/register page only |
| `pending` | Blocked screen: account pending approval |
| `rejected` / `disabled` | Blocked screen: account blocked/deactivated |
| `approved` (Normal User) | View/submit predictions, view standings, account settings |
| `approved` + `isSuperadmin` | All the above + Admin Panel (approve users, edit matches, recalculate standings) |

---

## 6. Application Flow

### Prediction Flow (Per-Match Predictions)

Predictions are league-specific. Users submit their prediction associated with a specific `leagueId`.

```
User opens /pronosticos
  → Server component loads matches and user predictions for the active pool (leagueId)
  → Client renders MatchCards with user's existing predictions and optional implied probabilities (OddsSnapshot)
  → User inputs score via Stepper widget
  → Server Action called: savePredictionAction(matchId, leagueId, home, away)
    → Validate: session exists and user is 'approved'
    → Validate: user is a member of the league (leagueId)
    → Validate: match.kickoff_utc > now() (HARD CUTOFF)
    → Upsert Prediction row in DB mapping (userId, leagueId, matchId)
  → Client updates local state
```

### Tournament Champion Prediction Flow

Users submit their tournament winner pick for each league before the league's `championDeadline`.

```
User selects Champion Team Code in /pronosticos Champion Widget
  → Server Action called: saveWinnerPredictionAction(leagueId, teamCode)
    → Validate: session exists and user is 'approved'
    → Validate: now() < league.championDeadline
    → Validate: user is a member of the league
    → Upsert WinnerPrediction row mapping (userId, leagueId)
```

### Champion Survivor Backend Flow

Champion Survivor is a separate competition type from full prediction mode. It uses `ChampionPick`, `TeamTournamentStatus`, and `ChampionOddsSnapshot`; it does not replace `WinnerPrediction` or use match prediction points.

`/competencia` is the canonical user-facing route for competition creation and detail pages. `/liga` remains as a legacy compatibility alias for existing links. Competition type is selected during creation and is read-only afterward. Creators are always owners/admins, while counting as a participant is explicit through `LeagueMember.isParticipant`.

```
User requests Champion Survivor state
  → Server Action validates approved session and league membership
  → League.competitionType must be champion_survivor
  → Current ChampionPick is joined with TeamTournamentStatus
  → Status is computed dynamically:
    pending if no pick
    alive if active/unknown/no status row
    eliminated if team status is eliminated
    winner if team status is champion
  → Latest ChampionOddsSnapshot per picked team provides market probability and expected value
```

```
User explicitly saves one champion pick
  → Server Action validates approved session, active participant membership, active league, and deadline
  → Selected team must belong to the derived eligible tournament roster
  → league.championDeadline is the hard cutoff
  → Pick is created or updated only if not already locked
  → lockedAt is set on save
```

Champion Survivor derives two server-side team sets. The visible set keeps safe historical picks available for dashboards, while the stricter writable set contains real teams found in tournament fixtures, explicit tournament statuses, or `outright_winner` snapshots. Both sets exclude bracket placeholders, and historical picks alone never authorize future writes.

`/pronosticos` also provides read-only Champion Survivor context below the explicit pick form:

- `Información de tu campeón` shows the selected or saved team, tournament status, champion market probability from `ChampionOddsSnapshot`, expected value, next match, recent result, match odds, and H2H when data exists.
- `Información de la competencia` shows recent results, upcoming matches, basic participant survival counts, and estimated prize pool.
- Match odds and H2H are contextual aids only. Champion market probability remains separate and never uses match odds as a substitute.
- `showOdds` hides champion odds, expected value, and match odds for participants. `showH2H` hides H2H for participants. Admin management remains available.
- Simulations and match-by-match tournament models remain outside this phase.

Champion Survivor also includes aggregate social and market panels for participants:

- `Mi pick vs mercado` uses only `ChampionOddsSnapshot` outright winner rows for champion probability, decimal odds, provider/bookmaker, captured time, and expected value.
- `Riesgo social` shows aggregate same-team pick counts, pick exclusivity, and individual estimated EV as `prizePool * championProbability / samePickCount` when market aids are enabled.
- `Pick popular vs pick diferencial` classifies picks with simple probability and popularity thresholds. Probability-based classification is hidden when `showOdds` is disabled.
- `Mapa de supervivencia` shows survival counts, pick distribution by team, exclusive picks, and combined alive probability when all alive teams have champion odds.
- Social counts and distribution are aggregate-only; participant names are not exposed in these panels. Simulations remain pending.

### Public Guest View

`/invitado` is a public read-only route for guests. It does not require authentication and shows the active competition marked as `League.isDefault = true`, reusing the existing single-principal competition rule. If no active principal competition exists, the page shows `Aún no hay una competencia principal configurada.` plus an `Iniciar sesión` button linking to `/login`.

The guest route never exposes forms, Server Actions, admin links, prediction inputs, or private user-management data. For `full_prediction` it shows public ranking, match results, upcoming matches, and aggregate champion pick distribution. For `champion_survivor` it shows aggregate survival counts, pick distribution, exclusive picks, recent results, and upcoming matches without the pick form. `showOdds` and `showH2H` still control whether public match odds and H2H context are displayed.

The shared application shell filters navigation from the resolved Better Auth session. Guests see only `Inicio` plus an `Iniciar sesión` action; authenticated competition, prediction, ranking, profile, and admin links are withheld while the session is pending and remain hidden when no session exists.

Admin competition management is exposed at `/admin/competencias`; `/admin/ligas` is a compatibility redirect. The underlying Prisma model remains `League`. Membership counts distinguish all `LeagueMember` rows from approved rows with `isParticipant = true`, which are the only rows used for participant and estimated prize-pool counts.

```
Admin or superadmin manages Champion Survivor
  → Server Action validates superadmin or league owner/admin role
  → Admin pick changes and resets require a non-empty reason
  → Team writes use the same eligible tournament roster as participant picks
  → Team tournament statuses are updated separately from user records
  → Only one champion status is accepted per league
  → Champion odds are outright_winner snapshots scoped to one active Survivor league
  → CSV export is generated as text/csv, not spreadsheet files
```

### Scoring and Recalculation Flow

Final result writes pass through a shared consistency helper: `status = result` and `resultStatus = final` require both scores, while knockout draws require a penalty winner. Provider diagnostics and bracket materialization are explicit superadmin operations in `/admin/resultados`; public page loads never call result providers or mutate fixtures. Round-of-32 third-place materialization uses the bundled, integrity-checked 495-row FIFA Annex C table and the fixed winner slot for each r32 match ID.

```
Admin enters result for a match
  → Server Action: updateMatchResultAction(matchId, homeScore, awayScore)
    → Validate: superadmin session
    → Update Match row (homeScore, awayScore, status='result')
    → Grade predictions for this match (calculatePoints using league-specific points configurations)
    → Trigger standings recalculation per league
      → For each league, aggregate per-match prediction points
      → If league championTeamCode is defined, add championPoints to users who predicted the correct winner
      → Apply tie-breaker rules to sort standings and update rankings snapshot (Standing)
```

### League Join Flow

```
User visits /join/[code] (or inputs inviteCode in the UI)
  → Validate: session exists and user is 'approved'
  → Validate: code matches a League.inviteCode and league is active/inviteEnabled
  → Validate: user not already a member
  → Create LeagueMember row
  → Redirect to home page (/)
```

### PM2 Ecosystem Config

```js
// ecosystem.config.js
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: 'lapolla2026',
    script: 'node_modules/.bin/next',
    args: 'start',
    cwd: '/home/pi/lapolla2026/app',
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: 'production',
      PORT: 3030,
    },
    max_restarts: 10,
    min_uptime: '10s',
    watch: false,
    log_date_format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss',
  }],
};
```

### Backup Cron

```bash
# /etc/cron.d/lapolla-backup
0 3 * * * pi sqlite3 /var/lib/la-polla-2026/prod.db ".backup '/var/lib/la-polla-2026/backups/lapolla-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sqlite'" && find /var/lib/la-polla-2026/backups -name 'lapolla-*.sqlite' -mtime +30 -delete
```

### Build and Delivery Strategy

- Code is pushed from Windows development environment to GitHub.
- Raspberry Pi 5 pulls updates via `git pull`.
- Next.js production build (`npm run build`) is executed directly on the Raspberry Pi 5.
- PM2 manages process restarts.
- Node.js 22 is installed on both Windows development laptop and Raspberry Pi 5.

## 8. Security Considerations

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Session hijacking | HttpOnly + Secure cookies; SameSite=Lax |
| CSRF on Server Actions | Next.js 16 Server Actions include built-in CSRF protection |
| Prediction after kickoff | Server-side cutoff check on every mutation |
| Admin privilege escalation | Superadmin flag checked server-side; not derived from request |
| SQLite injection | All queries via Prisma ORM — no raw SQL with user input |
| Secret exposure | .env and .env.local never committed; BETTER_AUTH_SECRET is server-only |
| DB file exposure | Stored outside webroot at `/var/lib/la-polla-2026/prod.db`; Cloudflare Tunnel does not expose filesystem |

## 9. Environment Variables

### Local Windows Development (`.env` or `.env.local` - NOT committed)
```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db?connection_limit=1&socket_timeout=20"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="<random-32-byte-hex-secret>"
APP_URL="http://localhost:3030"
```

### Raspberry Pi 5 Production (`.env` or `.env.local` - NOT committed)
```env
DATABASE_URL="file:/var/lib/la-polla-2026/prod.db?connection_limit=1&socket_timeout=20"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="<production-random-32-byte-hex-secret>"
APP_URL="https://lapolla.example.com"
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3030
```

# Provider credential boundary

`/admin/odds` receives only masked provider metadata. Server actions enforce superadmin access, encrypt new keys with AES-256-GCM, and persist quota/status metadata separately from the ciphertext. Runtime clients resolve credentials through the server-only provider credential layer before using the existing environment fallback.

Provider team identity is resolved through `TeamAlias`. `ProviderTeamOutcome` stores observed external names and their matched, unmatched, ambiguous, or ignored status. The odds pipeline loads provider-specific aliases before mapping events; result providers retain their code/ID matching and use exact aliases only as a conservative fallback.

# Visual mode boundary

The `viewMode` cookie stores `admin` or `participant` for superadmin presentation. The application combines it with the authenticated session before showing admin navigation or preview indicators. This cookie is not an authorization input; routes and actions continue to enforce permissions through Better Auth session data and database roles.

# Knockout progression boundary

All final result sources converge on `updateMatchResultInternal`. For knockout matches it invokes the server-only progression service, which builds a pure `Wxx`/`RUxx` plan, updates only placeholder-compatible match sides, and synchronizes initialized `TeamTournamentStatus` rows. The public application reads the resulting match and status data but never performs propagation writes.
